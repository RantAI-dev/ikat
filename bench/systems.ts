/**
 * IKAT-Bench step 4 — the systems under comparison.
 *
 * Every system shares the SAME corpus, chunker, embedder, generator, and top-k.
 * Only the figure mechanism differs. That is the entire point: any difference in
 * the results has exactly one cause, and no baseline can be accused of losing
 * because it was given a worse retriever.
 *
 *   S0 text_only     no figures at all — the floor, and the instrument for C1
 *   S1 caption_match our current production mechanism: caption keyword overlap
 *   S2 co_embed      figure embedded on its own text, competing in one index
 *   S4 anchor        ours: figure rides its anchor chunk, placed at that chunk's
 *                    citation
 *   S5 anchor_vlm    S4 plus a VLM description written once at ingest
 *   S6 anchor_hybrid ours: anchor for precision, description-similarity for
 *                    recall — built because S4 lost 3x to S2 on the questions
 *                    only a figure can answer, and the cause was structural
 *                    (anchoring inherits its recall from TEXT retrieval)
 *
 * S3 (VLM-over-page) and S6 (fine-tuned VLM) are not implemented here: both need
 * either per-query page images or a fine-tune, and are scoped separately. Their
 * absence is stated in the paper rather than papered over.
