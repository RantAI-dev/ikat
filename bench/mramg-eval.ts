/**
 * IKAT-Bench — evaluate our figure selection on MRAMG-Bench.
 *
 * Every number this project has produced was measured on a private corpus with a
 * gold standard we built ourselves and then found to be partly broken (80% of it
 * agrees with human judgement at chance — docs/paper/07-human-gold-audit.md).
 * That makes the results uncomparable to anything published, however carefully
 * they are tested internally.
 *
 * MRAMG-Bench (arXiv:2502.04176) fixes that: public data, published per-subset
 * numbers, and gold image lists we did not author. The Recipe subset is the one
 * that discriminates — its documents carry ~5 images each, so selection is a
 * real choice rather than a formality (on their Web subset the average document
 * has 1.0 images and every method scores near-identically).
 *
 * PROTOCOL, kept as close to theirs as our task allows:
 *   - Candidates are the images of the question's provenance document, which is
 *     what their LLM-based baseline sees.
 *   - Each image's text is the document prose IMMEDIATELY BEFORE its <PIC>
 *     placeholder. The document stores images inline in reading order, so this
 *     is the same anchor our own pipeline uses, and the same information their
 *     placeholder-based baseline has.
 *   - Image Precision, as defined in the paper: "the percentage of correct
 *     images in the multimodal answer relative to the total number of inserted
 *     images". Recall and F1 are reported alongside because precision alone can
 *     be bought with silence.
 *
 * What is NOT the same: their systems generate an answer and insert images while
 * we only select. Precision is computed over the same quantity — images emitted
 * versus images correct — so the comparison is meaningful, but it is a selection
 * result placed next to end-to-end systems, and that is stated rather than
 * glossed.
 *
 * Usage:
