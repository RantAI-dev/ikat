"""
Merge per-batch judge verdicts into the label file ppi-eval reads.

Judging was fanned out across agents, each writing verdicts-NNN-MMM.json for its
slice. This joins them back to the manifest, converts 1-based positions into
figure ids, and fails loudly on the two mistakes that would silently corrupt the
estimate:

  - a missing item, which would quietly shrink the unlabelled half
  - a duplicated item, which would let one batch's verdict overwrite another's

Neither would raise an error on its own, and both would change the number.
