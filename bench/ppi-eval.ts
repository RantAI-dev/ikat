/**
 * IKAT-Bench — prediction-powered estimates of figure selection.
 *
 * The problem this exists to solve: our strongest selection claim rests on 48
 * human-annotated items, and a reviewer is right to say that is thin. Annotating
 * more is the honest fix and remains outstanding. This is the other half — a way
 * to spend a large pile of judge labels WITHOUT letting the judge's bias into
 * the number.
 *
 * ── Why not just score against the judge ──────────────────────────────────
 * Because we measured what that costs. A model-built gold inflates a pipeline
 * containing a model by roughly 1.9x (0.521 against 0.283 on the same system),
 * and our pre-existing harness gold agrees with a person at chance (kappa 0.092).
 * A bigger pile of judge labels is a bigger pile of that bias.
 *
 * ── What a rectified estimator does instead ───────────────────────────────
 * Following the prediction-powered inference idea (Angelopoulos et al.; used for
 * RAG evaluation by ARES, NAACL 2024), the judge is treated as a cheap, biased
 * instrument whose bias is MEASURED on the human-labelled subset and subtracted:
 *
 *     theta_ppi = theta(judge, all items) - [ theta(judge, L) - theta(human, L) ]
 *                 \_______ cheap _______/   \______ the correction ________/
 *
 * The bracket is the judge's bias, estimated where both labels exist. What makes
 * this worth doing rather than merely clever: if the judge is useless, the
 * correction cancels the cheap term and the estimate degrades to the human-only
 * one. It cannot make the number wrong — only fail to make it tighter. That is a
 * strictly better bargain than a silver-gold set, which can be confidently wrong.
 *
 * ── The estimand is pool-restricted, and that is not Table III ────────────
 * The human and the judge both labelled candidates within a per-question pool.
 * So every number here is "of the pool candidates, which did the system emit",
 * which is a different quantity from the open-universe selection in the paper's
 * Table III. It is reported as its own row, never as a replacement.
 *
 * Confidence intervals are bootstrap over QUESTIONS, not over pairs: pairs
 * within a question share a candidate pool and are not independent, and
 * resampling them would report an interval narrower than the data supports.
 *
 * ── The gate, and why it currently fails ──────────────────────────────────
 * The correction is only unbiased if the human-labelled pairs are a RANDOM
 * subsample of the population being estimated. On the data as it stands they are
 * not, and the script refuses to print estimates because of it.
 *
 * The two labelling passes used different pools (eight candidates, then six).
 * Their intersection is what carries both labels — and every harness-gold figure
 * is in both pools by construction, 38 of 38. So the overlap is enriched in
 * positives: 12.1% of overlap pairs are human-YES against 4.9% across the full
 * human protocol, a factor of 2.46. Correcting with a subsample that skews that
 * far toward positives would push the estimate in a direction we cannot bound.
 *
 * What unblocks it is not more human work: it is judge labels on pools drawn the
 * same way the annotator's were. That needs the figure crops for ugm3-built,
 * which no longer exist on disk — 55% of them survive inside the two annotation
 * exports, but rebuilding pools from only the surviving crops would bias the
 * DISTRACTORS instead, which is the same disease in a new place.
 *
